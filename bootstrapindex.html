        <!-- Post Content -->
        <p class="lead">   Hello, my name is Mikaila McNary and I am a third year undergraduate student at Cal Poly Orfalea College of Business. I am studying Economics with a concentration in Quantitative Analysis as well as a minoring in Political Science.
           I'm interested in exploring how various issues in our political economy interact with and affect the overall macro economy.
         </p>

        <p> Within my short three years at Cal Poly, I have assisted the Economics department in conducting research regarding the social and economic impacts of legalized cannabis in certain states, in
         addition to its potential prenatal affects. I have also written a paper in collaboration with professors from both the Economics and Political Science departments analyzing the social costs and
         micro economic impacts of targeted regulation of abortion provider (TRAP) laws.</p>

        <p> In addition to my studies, I have immersed myself in campus life by being an active member of both Cal Poly Economics Society as well as Pilipino Culture Exchange for all three years. I hope to
         continue my involvement in these clubs, as they are an integral part of my identity as both an Economics student and Filipina American.</p>
